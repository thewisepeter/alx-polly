### Feature: Viewing Poll Results and Data Visualization

We've been working on enabling the viewing of individual poll results, which is a prerequisite for displaying poll data as a graph. This involved debugging several issues related to data retrieval from Supabase.

**Debugging Journey:**

1.  **Initial Problem:** The `get_poll_results` Supabase function was being called with an object containing named parameters, but it expected positional arguments.
    *   **Resolution:** We modified the `supabaseServer.rpc` call in `src/lib/db/polls.ts` to pass `poll_id`, `filter_user_id`, and `filter_anonymous_user_id` positionally.

2.  **Undefined Variable Error:** After the initial fix, `poll_id` was reported as undefined within the `getPollResults` function.
    *   **Resolution:** We corrected the variable names in the `rpc` call to use the properly defined `pollId`, `filterUserId`, and `filterAnonymousUserId`.

3.  **`supabaseServer` Null Error:** A "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'head')" error emerged, suggesting that the `supabaseServer` object was `null` or `undefined` when the `.rpc` call was made.
    *   **Debugging Steps:**
        *   We added `console.log` statements in `src/lib/db/polls.ts` to inspect the value of `supabaseServer` before the `rpc` call.
        *   We then added detailed `console.log` statements within the `createServerSupabaseClient` function in `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` to examine the `cookieStore` and the client object being returned, to understand why `supabaseServer` might be null.

4.  **Next.js Route Error:** During the debugging of the `supabaseServer` issue, a Next.js Route error was identified in `src/app/poll/[id]/page.tsx`, where `params.id` was being accessed without awaiting the `params` object.
    *   **Resolution:** We updated `src/app/poll/[id]/page.tsx` to correctly await the `params` object and destructure `id` as `pollId`.

5.  **Current Status:** We are currently facing a "PGRST202" error from Supabase, indicating an issue with the `get_poll_results` function itself, likely related to its expected parameters or internal logic.
